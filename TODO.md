# TODO

- [ ] Add a default tips.txt file
      Wondering where I should put the default tips? Maybe in a default_tips
      node in the daily-focus.json file?
      Maybe add a default_tip with "Add tips to <tip_dir>" if no tips file is
      found. We want users to create their own tips that are meaningful to them
      in an easily accessible place.
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add function to set current line number
